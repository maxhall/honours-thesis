# TODO

# Deck clearing day!!
* Then do the same for supervision feedback and notes from conversations with people
* Go through gKeep notes and incorporate those into the outlines
* Review outline to make sure the reading direction and reference needs are indicated for each section

* Sort through open research links, download the good ones
* Sort PDFs
* Reread C's emails on submission details
* Flesh out referencing system by doing a couple of bibtex references

* Find a home for the objection that the lack of certainty about being able to successfully influence beleif (and even the lack of certainty that we won't do harm to that persons character in the process) is a good reason to avoid challenging belief. This might be a "argument for minimising influence from epistemic uncertainty"

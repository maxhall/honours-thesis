## Discussion notes from supervision meeting

Headline is the decision to spend another week reading, and consider more closely the relationship between belief and behaviour qua modification strategies:

Could go for strategies that change behaviour and beliefs/values
Might say that it’s just easier to tell when behaviour has actually changed: epistemic accessibility. Relevant to juridical processes
- Moral status of changing these: Changing behaviour without changing beliefs/changing behaviour while changing beliefs
- Should we prefer one?
- What justifies each of these
- E.g. Slavery strategies -> Anderson papers
- Is it better or worse to change one or the other
J: what we really care about is changing attitudes/behaviour
- Racism example: getting people to conceal it is at best a half-victory
- Extra problem: edge cases where we change beliefs but not the behaviour -> peer pressure scenarios. Someone might believe that their friends are sexist but never say anything
Who are we making belief/behaviour changes for: Are you changing people's beliefs because it’s better for them or because it's better for society
Who is the focus of the change: changing people's’ values, do you have an eye to their wellbeing
- Moral paternalism
A: Think about distinguishing between behaviours and habits

### The justification of interventions intended to inculcate moral virtue

"Justification"
* To what extent does it depend on the substance of the inculcated virtue/view? I.e. We are justified in intervening when we are right
* Probably not: even if we're right we shouldn't for other to change themselves
* We are motivated to be legitimately able to influence others, even when we do not agree
* The reasons it is okay to do a thing, orwhy a practive or intervention is legitimate and should not be opposed

"Inteventions"
* Anything we do intentionally/unintentionally as an individual/citizen/institution that is intended to/expected to/actuall does/intended to&&actually does change them in some (relevant?) way

"Cultivate"
- Make conditions that allow for, encourage, incude, develop, alter in a (slow/some pace?) way
* How does intention play here. We're interested in what we're justified in doing. I.e. we have a set of moral behaviours that we want to encourage in others, now what are we allowed to do to make them do it? So we only take explicitly intentional things in the scope

"moral virtue"
* Virtue externally defined? How defined? Ideally?
* General questions about what we actually care about when we say we care about virtue
* It may not be a matter of virtue in any case: Take into account demands for effective citizenship, civic duty, national pride, a sense of community, common humanity stuff, disposition towards considering/aiding others, criticial reasoning, complacency, conformity to x norms, respect for authority, 'common sense'

We're working on the impact of instituions and individuals.
Re individuals consider: austonomy, capacities to learn, the need to be taught, relationship between needing to be taught inorder to function socially and our independance as a social agent, the source of moral characters (or at least a particular part of it), what can we justifiably do (socially) to others, what can the do to us, what maximises autonomy? Liberal approach along the lines of giving reasons && being right?

Rephrasing: Are we justified in trying to inculcate moral virtue in those who disagree with us? If so, how?

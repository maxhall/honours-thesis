# Feedback from supervision to incorporate

1. L pointed out that people can be non-voluntarists but still believe in influence:
	* You might think that you can present evidence that will necessarily (i.e. non-voluntaristically) modify someone's beliefs. This is the view of a "lot of people" (find out who) who are pro-argumentation.
	* Think about perceptual cases (I see the sun shining and believe that it is shining; it is very difficult to believe otherwise)
2. How does the case of people who can't change their belief when they try to fit into this all? The recalcitrant belief case (perhaps one where they're voluntarily consenting to more extreme influence)
3. Is belief subject to the will?
	* This is potentially domain-specific where it is in some instance but not in others. E.g. My belief the sun is shining does not seem to be subject to the will; many religious people would make a similar claim
	* Consider cases: a. Perceptual belief, b. Religious belief, c. A lack of evidence either way
	* There might be a limited, domain-specific voluntarist
4. Questions about people who self-report being unable to change their beliefs:
	* It might be the case that they're mistaken, or that they're strategically shielding their beliefs. (Can you disown your own belief in a meaningful way? To not be responsible for it? Does it make sense to say that we're morally responsible for our beliefs in some way?)
	* How should we think about reports? see discussion further down re DBM's view
5. On the terminology of moral significance:
	* How does moral beliefs relate to moral values and moral judgements? Are they the same thing? Are beliefs a component or subset of moral values. I think we want to say that they're the same thing
	* Another distinction that might be drawn in this vein: some beliefs are non-derivative value judgements, while others are empirical beliefs that have moral impacts.
	* The latter. Vaccine’s are harmful is an empirical belief with moral impact;
	* The former. Homosexual couples are not fit to raise children because of their sexuality. I have written but don’t think it works: "I believe that the children of homosexual couples have more mental health problems [this is owing to their parents’ homosexuality]”.
6. Check how the literature uses the term "value judgements" – might be what we need
7. Find as opponents of positive belief change: People who think that value judgements are a part of a persons identity that are worthy of respect
	* Christine Korsgaard: Kantian who thinks that value judgements are a kind of self-preservation kind of identity thing; connected to conscience
	* Maquarie Uni conference or meeting on this stuff that happened on the 11th
8. If it's true that beliefs are conscience judgements or form an integral part of our indentity are we allowed to insulate them from criticism or influence?
	* L thinks (and I agree that this is worth pushing back against)
	* Wrap up with the even if of "we're influencing anyway" so still need to know, normatively, how we ought to do that
9. What are the grounds for ascribing moral values to someone?
	* There are big differences between verbal reports and behaviour
	* You could say that people are acting inconsistently with their values
	* OR these people are deluded about their values, because their behavious indicates that they do not hold them
	* EARLY IN SECTION 2: I’m not just interested in when is it permissable to change peoples reports, I’m interested in actually changing beliefs
	* DBM's (kinda contentious) view on this is (I think, remembering here) that it's just behaviour
9. What I need more of
	* Direct engagement with opponents
	* To bump up conclusion: Identify two or three trade offs

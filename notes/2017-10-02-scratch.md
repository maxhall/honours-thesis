* Formalise the account of MSB:
  * How does moral beliefs relate to moral values and moral judgements? Are they the same thing? Are beliefs a component or subset of moral values. I think we want to say that they're the same thing

* All beliefs my be subjects to challenge
* We have a claim to freedom of belief that isn't derived from moral significance of the belief


Is the MSB thing just justifying the examples I'm going to focus on?
And then it will become clear in four that some things we want socially

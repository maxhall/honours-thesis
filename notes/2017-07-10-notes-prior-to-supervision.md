## Notes prior to supervision

Three things:
Go through a change of focus to justifications of strategies that affect behaviour
Strategic questions
Want to change the focus to behaviour
Previously: What we are justified in doing to change others’ moral character?

The problem with this:
I ended up thinking of moral character in terms of behaviour rather than attitudes
I think objections about private beliefs/we can think what we want are reasonably persuasive, and also a total minefield
It’s not clear what it means for our beliefs to be authentically our own:
situationist problems
Beliefs are just rationalisation of emotion
Sorting out the affective/cognitive
They’re not important anyway because all sorts of things mean they’re not converted into action and as such don’t affect anyone
So I don’t think I can make particular headway addressing the moral character and I think it might become a bit of a mess

The more interesting intuition/how we can frame the inquiry:
There are different moral behaviours we wished everyone performed
Giving to charity, not eating meat, refusing to steal
There are different strategies that tend to cause individuals to perform or not perform behaviours
Persuasion, education, threats, advertising, nudging, shaming
What could be added structurally:
Liberal principles are the most common answer, but not completely clear
They’re used to for advertising standards
Persuasion is a mess, other things (social isolation, shaming, nudging) seem fine
Find some competing thoughts and analyse them or apply them

What this rules out:
More abstract considerations of moral behaviour
Questions of what it means for people to have a belief
Does this let me be agnostic about moral realism? Whether or not you think it’s important what people actually believe I ti

What this rules in:
Indoctrination, Brainwashing, Persuasion, education, threats, advertising, nudging, shaming
Interesting examples: Use of images by people who oppose abortions

Things from the readings
Lots of persuasion literature
Arguments that traditionally accepted techniques of persuasion amount to coercion
Probable options
Can liberalism be defended against competing claims
Most conservative mainstream is political liberal demands for public justification and overlapping consensus
Mainly claims to autonomy, respect; Nussbaum capabilities -> doesn’t inhibit capabilities for autonomy
People this is opposed to:
Generally claim that the moral reality is that we won’t achieve decent results by trying justification
Some say that liberal justification is paternalistic or coercive anywaytc
Consequentialist who just want to get things done
Tempted by nudging
Against autonomy; pro paternalism

Kinds of standards advanced:
Stacks and stacks on autonomy and liberal derivatives

Fricker, communicative blame

Moral rebukes and social avoidance

LAUREN BIALYSTOK - Canadian social justice education:
Have legislative backing in the form of such documents as the Charter, human rights codes, and current policy
Be compatible with reasonable pluralism
Not engage in partisan politicsorpoliticalactivismthatstudentsdonotchoose
be connected with developing skills for democratic engagement
respect students’ freedom to abstain from activities that contravene their own (emerging or tentative) comprehensive doctrines
Strategic questions
Does that framing work in terms of avoiding too much of a background commitment

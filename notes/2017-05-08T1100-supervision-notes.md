### Summary email sent to the group prior to submission

Hi all,

Rather than circulating anything too substantial, I’m hoping to use tomorrow’s meeting to pick your collective brains and narrow down the direction of my thesis. Also Kryssa and Yann, I know it’s crunch time for you both so more than happy to yield some time to your work if that’s helpful!

A few rough motivating thoughts for discussion tomorrow:

I’m looking at the justification of interventions intended to alter someone’s moral character. Interesting questions in the area include: What are institutions permitted to do to influence the morality of individuals? Consider the government writing “aussie values” in history syllabi or a company using psychological nudging to increase employee loyalty. How far can parents go in teaching their children contested views? What is the substance of a legitimate (in some sense) moral education?

I’m specifically interested in what you are permitted to do to change someone’s moral values or views when you disagree with them. This would aim to clarify the intuition that somewhere on the imagined spectrum of view-changing interventions — say from polite, reasoned discussion to tortuous brainwashing — there is a point at which the interventions are no longer permissible.

Consider the example of an grandfather who has never been persuaded to support gay marriage but begrudgingly comes to profess support for it after his younger family members threaten to cease contact with him. The younger family members are doing no moral wrong in their original attempt to reason with their grandfather. But are they justified in using the threat of social alienation to change his views? If yes, how far could they go to change their grandfather’s view?

Relevant questions: How do we distinguish between permissible and impermissible interventions? What factors – say consideration of autonomy, a requirement for mutual respect or reasons giving, etc – help with the distinction. To what extent are the permissible interventions dependent on the content of the view with which we disagree? Intuitively, we're likely inclined to go further to change the moral character of a racist than I am someone who doesn’t think vegetarianism is morally required.

# Notes from supervision

## Options for managing the scope of the thesis:
- Look closely at a couple of example strategies for intervention, choose three or something
- Try and pick three that mark our significant distinguishing cases along the spectrum
- Outline your ideas, and apply it closely to one very specific recent public case
   - Consider the shaming of the academic in the US

## Things to try looking for literature on
- Epistemic volunteerism (can we change our beliefs/are they voluntary)
   - Adam suggest thinking about Pascal’s Wager - “I believe this because it’s useful”
   - Is it even possible to force people to change their beliefs
   - Jessie suggested psych research about belief following behaviour
- Moral disagreement
- Moral Confidence
- Political liberalism
- Epistemic doubt
   - By putting ourselves in a shared space of reasons we open our own ideas to critique
   - Requirement for reasons giving
- Relational autonomy/respect -> Suggested by Kryssa
   - Uma Nareyan
- Specific interventions
   - Chemical castration of sex criminals
   - Indoctrination
      - Missionary schools
   - Bribery
   - Lying
   - Advertising
   - Shaming, call out culture
- Anti-retributivist approaches to punishment
   - Their justification will depend on what it is permissible to do to change peoples’ minds
   - Circle sentencing in Aboriginal communities
- Thought crime
- Libertarian paternalism
- Paternalism in general

## Things people might say
- There are a bunch of different reasons why people from different schools of thought will want to be able to change minds
   - Moral realists who are confident there is moral truth want to change others to believe the truth
   - Non-cognitivists (flesh this out) will also want to change people's’ minds for a bunch of reasons depending on their view
- Have to think about what consequentialists/non-consequentialists would say:
   - Consequentialists might say that any mind-changing strategy, even very harmful ones like brainwashing, is legitimate so long as it has the right effect
   - Other consequentialists might say that the harmful consequences of the strategies makes them impermissible
   - Non-conseqs would say that there are strategies that are just wrong; murder and sterilisation, perhaps
- Think about what kind of changes your strategies are aimed at
   - Currently views/beliefs/moral character
   - Not behaviour
   - So note the difference between behaviour modifications and attitude changes
   - If they’re not linked, people might ask: why do we care about attitudes? Is the basic principle not that we can think whatever we want
- Think about the situationist considerations

## Things that might distinguish permissible strategies
- Liberal political phil stuff
   - Only do stuff that involves reasons giving in a public space
   - Mutual respect (I have to be as open to the strategy as it is open to me)
- The strategy is impermissible when the harm caused by it is worse than the harm done by the thing it’s trying to change

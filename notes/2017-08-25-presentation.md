# To do

* Sort through recent notes and identify things I _need_ to read
* Start dividing into sections
* Write out examples for intuition pumping -


Presentation slides: [link here]

# Intro

[Slide: bliss desktop background]

My thesis is looking at what we are justified in doing to change other peoples belief

What I'm going to do today:

* Shamelessly use the room to pump some intuitions, and hopefully confirm a few of my own
* Clarify the point of what I'm doing, outline a couple of strategic moves I'm making particularly re the nature of belief, and make a couple of distinctions
* Try and make a mess of what we all feel we are justified in doing to change other peoples deeply held moral beliefs

# Intuition pumping

[Slide: Gif of water being pumped]

* I'm going to shamelessly exploit you all being compelled to be here to test your intuitions on when a whole bunch of interventions are justified

[Slide: Interactive lecture reference]

* You have to take this seriously because I have a reference that says this is a good and engaging lecturing technique. I just want you to put your hands up if you think you are justified in doing the thing.
* Easy example: Without prompting a friend asks you to give them reasons why we should grant refugees the same . Are you justified in persuading them?



* Is it okay to change

# Can we change peoples beliefs?

# The problem with beliefs

* Should we change beliefs?
* What counts as changing beliefs? How do we change
	* The best way to change other peoples beliefs is just having them publicly commit to another set of beliefs
* Try and flesh out how messy this gets

# Things we do to change other people's minds

Brainwashing -> intractable beliefs that are (sufficiently) detrimental to society
Minute on each strategy + a reference for each


# Where this leaves us / where the project needs to head

What a synthesis of this would need to do

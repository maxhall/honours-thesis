### Fricker communicative blame
- Was raised in the context of the MaqU forgiveness workshop
- Roughly: Inspire remorse through blame in order to achieve aligned values
- Relevant then: Who has standing to blame in Fricker's communicative blame? If it's a normative thing, affects who is justified in doing what
- Matilda suggested: pedagogy of discomfit, social justice education

* Could look into the way that the presumption that it is persuasion (i.e. actual change in belief) that causes mass social change, not a change in behaviour resulting in a whole lot of people eventually changing their belif
* Could even look at instances where there is a mess of this. Take for example a country where 51% persaude and then vote for marriage equality, how then should we think about the changing attitude of the remaining 49%? (This is a bad example because there isn't a particular modification strategy at issue.)

* Pitched a version of the thesis that takes opposing examples of cases, one where behaviour has been changed but belief has not been, another where belief has changed but behaviour cannot be.

* There is the intuition that we really don't want to demand that we ought to want to change belief when we've achieved a just outcome in behaviour

* Consider instead the case where we know we can't change behaviour (perhaps because of social pressure or communicative context). In this instance, is there any value to changing belief?
	* In a world where everyone is publicly discriminatory towards short people, would we prefer that they privately believe the opposite, that their beliefs match their actions (because that validates the way we want a moral society to work), or do we not care because all we care about it action.

* Important consideration (perhaps opening chapter) is motivating why we care about belief:
	* Even when action is constrained allows us to distinguish between which agents are moral or not. I.e. it influences how we decide responsibilty
	* It's an important feature of our systemic approaches to morality. We educate and persuade as if it's important
	* Influences massively how we select methods of moral control

Conversation w/ J:

* What are we justified in believing?
* What do people actually mean when they claim "I have a right to my beliefs?"
* Difference between belief/opinion
* The intuition that we should let people believe what they want to believe so long as they don't behave in accordance w/ "bad" beliefs runs up against the intuition that we resent (and want to change) someone we know to be sexist even though they haven't treated someone differently because of their gender

# Intro

[Slide: bliss desktop background]

My thesis asks what are we justified in doing to change other people's beliefs about moral matters.

The fantasy would be to circle in on some necessary conditions for when we’re okay to use different belief-changing strategies on people. For reasons I’ll dig into in a bit I’m not sure how close I’ll get, but the idea is at least to clarify the problems and draw together some disparate approaches in the literature.

I’m going to do four things today:

1. Shamelessly use the room to pump some intuitions, and hopefully confirm a few of my own
2. Say a little more to motivate my project
3. Justify a couple of strategic moves I'm making to keep the scope in check
4. Roughly sketch some approaches to answering the questions we ask in the first bit, and their shortcomings

# Intuition pumping

[Slide: Pumping gif]

* I'm going to shamelessly exploit you all being compelled to be here to test your intuitions on when a whole bunch of interventions are justified
* I just want you to put your hands up if you think you are justified in doing the thing. You have to take this seriously because I have a slide with a reference that says this is a good and engaging lecturing technique.

[Slide: Persuasive debate]

* Easy case: Persuade someone who has, unprompted, asked to be persuaded that gay couples are of equal moral standing

[Slide: Public shaming]

* Are you justified in publicly shaming them for believing that, with a view to changing their belief?

[Slide: Friends excluding]

* To slightly vary it. Can you coordinate with your close friendship group to socially exclude a friend who doesn’t believe gay couples are of equal moral standing until they appear to change this belief

[Slide: Charlottesville Nazis]

* Are we justified in abducting a white supremacist who believes all people of colour to be of inferior moral status and trying to reprogram them?

[Slide: Baby]

* Are we justified in writing syllabuses aimed to ensure that they never hold that belief in the first place?

[Slide: Text “indoctrination”]

* Force an adult to spend 8 hours a day for years of their life being told by an authority figure contributing to civic society is good, to try and make them believe in civic contribution?

[Slide: Classroom and HSIE syllabus]

* Is it okay to force a kid to go through the same?

* What about if you know that child is raised in a such a way they will never be exposed to alternate views?

[Slide: anti-communist propaganda]

* Are we allowed to use large-scale propaganda to change a population's political beliefs?

# Motivating

[Slide: Okay why?]

Why talk about justification of influence?

1. We inevitably have all kinds of influence on others. That’s reason enough to want to get a handle on whether the status quo is justifiable.

[Slide: Facebook screenshots of concerned parents]

2. But it’s also something that just about everyone cares about at some point when they want to change others’ minds, or find the efforts of others to change theirs intrusive or coercive. [ADD NOTE RE THE PARENTS]

3. It’s something philosophers are particularly interested in. If we have all of these wonderfully derived normative conclusions that we believe in, we want there to be some uptake. It’s particularly politically useful: If we are justified in doing things other than speaking reasons into the ether of a structurally oppressive society, then it would be great to know how far we can go.

[Slide: Persuasion and coercion book cover]

4. Finally, we’re raised to think of persuasion as the respectful, reasons-giving process of dialog that lets us legitimately change others mind on important things. This is deeply embedded in our norms of acceptable behaviour: in how courts of law run, and as the default appropriate way to try and influence someone. But the literature agrees that it isn’t all it’s cracked up to be for two reasons.

* First, it’s not a complete picture of how we come to for beliefs. We don’t give kids beliefs through persuasion: it’s imagination or stipulation, and social circumstances and threats seem just as likely to be the cause of many of our moral belief changes than reasons-giving persuasion. It’s important that our theory of legitimate influence take this into account.

* Second, the literature on persuasion thinks and I agree, that in a lot of cases rational reasons-giving persuasion looks uncomfortably coercive when you take into account imbalances of power, wearing-down your opponent, or disagreement about the extent to which belief is something we rationally revise in the first place.

[Slide: Why belief?]

So why focus on belief?

There are good reasons we should be hesitant spending any time trying to justify intervening in what other people believe. You might say:

* Beliefs are private and we have some kind of right to them. To intervene to alter them would be to police my thoughts or grievously violate my freedoms.
* It’s really difficult to distinguish when people have a actually changed what they believe from just superficially changing their behaviour

Would we not be better then to talk about influencing behaviour and not beliefs?

* We  generally profess belief and reasons to have a central role in public discourse and determining our individual actions and society. To this end, we use people's beliefs to help decide whether they are morally responsible for their actions – say as an aggravating factor in hate crimes sentencing.

* We also just by and large act as if it is really important what. Consider a case of a society that has massive peer pressure to be publicly discriminatory towards short people. Even if they had no way of expressing it at all, I think we would intuitively still value other citizens believing that short people ought not to be discriminated against.

* A lot of people whose behaviours we might like to change—say religious opponents of gay marriage, or libertarians who refuse to countenance the view that we owe the impoverished anything—proclaim to be acting on their beliefs. I think _prima facie_ we should take them at their word and look to engage with what they claim to be the source of their views and behaviour.

* In terms of positive reason: beliefs, once they are socially entrenched are more persistent and flexible than behaviour. If we can legitimately influence beliefs, then it may be that we have a better chance of inculcating morally good behaviour.

[Slide: Theses don’t write themselves]

* The choice is also strategic, there is lot less written about it belief-changing

On a final note, nhy talk about moral beliefs? (And not say beliefs about the existence of aliens.)

* We want to change other people's moral convictions because it affects how they treat you. They’re the beliefs that most influence others lives and writ large determine society. In this sense, they’re the ones we are most likely to have a claim to change (if standing becomes an issue).

# My approach

* It would be entirely possible to write on any one of those the particular belief-changing strategies I gestured to in the examples earlier. My project makes some calls to manage the scope of what I have to deal with.

[Slide: What I’m avoiding]

What I'm not going to deal with:

* Philosophy of mind stuff as to the nature of belief.
* Epistemic issues about whether you should hold certain beliefs.
* Nitty gritty psychology of the mechanisms that cause belief to change.

On each of these fronts there are a bunch of views. I Intend to politely leave those questions to people who have the relevant expertise, because cramming it into one thesis seems unwise. That isn't to say that I think they _actual_ detail of what does and does not change belief won't have bearing on which of those strategies are justified. But I do think we can come some way to in circumscribing what we are comfortable with before needing details of what particular strategies do.

[Slide: What I’m assuming]

So here’s what I end up presuming:

* People believe morally important things
* You can do things to people to change their beliefs
* This needn't be too precise, and the methods don’t have to be 100% accurate. We’re just looking to hone in one strategies that somewhat reliably lead to belief change.

# Candidate answers

[Slide: republican candidates]

So where to from here. The stage I’m at at the moment is digging through candidate answers in the literature.

Candidates:

1. Influences or interventions that are monological are coercive and wrong, interventions that create dialogue are fine
2. Interventions to change belief should mainly be education when we’re young; that is prior to the development of socially recognised autonomy
3. We can do anything so long as we preserve freedom of choice. (A lot of nudge theorists say this.)
4. Only indirect coercion of our beliefs—say through compulsory education—is fine.
5. “Has a negative effect on them moral character of involved parties” or conversely “does not allow someone to consciously reflect on and attempt to develop their moral beliefs”

# Skip this bit

* At this stage, I think there is a defensible weak position where you at least two things are necessary for you to be justified applying a belief-changing strategy to someone:
  1. You have to tell them what you’re trying to do
  2. They have to have the opportunity to avoid it

* Host of problems with this
* On the first condition:
	* Handling of unconscious strategies
	* On the other extreme, some people might say it’s overly demanding; we would spend our lives warning people that the conversations we are having with them might change their beliefs and second-guessing whether we intend to change their beliefs and thereby need to declare it

* On the second condition:
	* Letting people avoid belief-changing strategies isn’t good enough, because there are, I think, compelling cases where people who are resistant to even explicit belief-change should be subjected to it.

# Conclusion

* So, there’s a whole lot of background and a bunch of interesting questions that I’m sorting through. I’m not there yet with an actual conclusion—so would welcome any and all thoughts—but hopefully have indicated the avenue I’m headed down and a couple of the roadblocks on the way.

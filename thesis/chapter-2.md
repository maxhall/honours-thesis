% Morally Significant Beliefs

This paper is concerned with the strategies an individual is justified in adopting when they want to influence another’s beliefs. This chapter specifies the class of “morally significant beliefs” whose justified influence we are interested in, identifies features of the class that will assist with our later discussion and addresses its relationship to the philosophy of belief.

Most simply, your morally significant beliefs are the moral and value judgements and other moral commitments you have made that are likely to be disagreed with and contested by others. The class intends to capture the moral beliefs that we often feel most like we ought to try and change in others. That is, the most common and consequential sources of disagreement; those at the centre of debates and situations where we feel injustice has been done. [Flesh out here if needs be.]

The central beliefs that count as morally significant on this account are reasonably intuitive to grasp. Statements such as “gay couples ought not to have the same legal status as straight couples owing to their sexual orientation”, “all people should be maximally free and equal and a society’s institutions should reflect this”, “abortion is wrong”, “white people are morally superior to others and are thus deserving of greater rights”, “a transcendent god exists and their followers teachings are the only true source of moral judgements”, “climate change is fake” and “vaccines cause autism in children and are thereby morally wrong” all express paradigmatic examples of morally significant beliefs.
While the beliefs just listed are, I hope, intuitively related it bears emphasising the variety of reasons that they are morally significant. Some make moral claims about others (“gay couples ought not to have the same legal status as straight couples owing to their sexual orientation”), the effect they have on others’ lives (“abortion is wrong”) or ought to be counted as morally significant because they’re empirical claims with moral consequences (“climate change is fake”). This breadth, I think, effectively captures the kind of deeply-held moral commitments that tend to give rise to claims that certain beliefs should be immune from criticism or influence. We will examine these claims in chapter three.

[Moral significance mess]

The example beliefs cited can all be reasonably characterised as serious moral issues and are the subject of substantial contemporary disagreement. But it is not necessary for our purposes to exclude less hotly contested beliefs from the class of morally significant beliefs. What is morally significant, and the magnitude of a beliefs significance is socially

But I do not exclude from the class of morally significant beliefs many beliefs that others’ might well like to influence but which do not meet some sense of moral significance. Statements like “Tuesday is always a miserable day”, “Manchester United is the only football club worth supporting” and “I believe LCD Soundsystem has released the only album worth of praise in 2017” are belief statements, but are not morally significant.

It does not matter for now that it is unclear precisely which beliefs are morally significant. [Reason for this].
Allow me to point out a few features of the class morally significant beliefs which will be important to our later discussion.

First, both direct moral judgements and empirical judgements with moral consequences are included. A direct moral judgement does not rely on any empirical claim. Consider a racist’s view that people of colour are innately undeserving of that same moral status as white people. This belief makes no empirical claim. By contrast a belief such as “vaccines cause autism in children and are thereby morally wrong” does make an empirical claim. It is important that we include both types of beliefs in the scope of our discussion for two reasons. First, both types feature heavily in contemporary debates, particularly when the moral consequences of empirical claims are at issue as in debates about vaccines, climate change, and access to guns. Further, it is often unclear whether someone’s belief is contingent on an empirical claim or not. It is easy to imagine the racist’s belief mentioned just now framed not as ‘people of colour are innately undeserving of the same moral status as white people’, but ‘I believe that crime statistics warrant my belief that people of colour are innately undeserving of the same moral status as white people’. Such slippage between direct moral judgement and empirical judgement with moral consequences is common enough that we are best to consider both as morally significant beliefs. Second, beliefs that make empirical claims are likely to be responsive to different types of belief-influence that we will discuss in chapter five: it is a very different thing to give someone evidence for your belief in the science and positive public health function of vaccines, than it is to give reasons for your belief in an omnipotent god.

Second, religious beliefs are included in the class of morally significant beliefs. Their inclusion should be uncontroversial. Religious beliefs are precisely the type of deeply-held but regularly contested belief that we have discussed thus far. Consideration of religious belief is of particular use to our study because religious adherents often claim that no interpersonal belief-influence strategy can influence their faith beliefs. This being true (I will return claims of uninfluencable belief later) it is difficult to imagine the permissibility of any belief-influencing strategy that might cause personal disruption for the subject when the strategy is aimed at a altering a belief  that cannot change. Finally, religion also offers one of the clearest examples of an individual motivated to influence others’ beliefs: the evangelist.

Third, what counts as a morally significant belief clearly changes over time and is culturally and socially located. Once, moral norms and the authority of the Catholic Church were such that whether one believed that the earth revolved around the sun was an empirical claim of extreme moral significance. Now, of course, what was Galileo’s loss is our gain. It is not just morally permissible to be a heliocentrist committed to the view that the earth and planets orbit the sun, it is difficult to conceive of the issue as a moral one at all. [Are there additional contemporary examples I can go for?] It is with this feature of our social moral lives in mind that I keep open that what counts as a morally significant belief might be the subject of as much contest as the beliefs themselves. This means our account of legitimate belief-influencing strategies must be responsive to changing moral norms.

This is particularly evident in making the fourth observation that some morally significant beliefs have different credence than others at different times, in different communities. The moral beliefs of the early suffragettes or slavery abolitionists were at one time far from the most commonly held beliefs about voting and slavery of their respective societies, but those beliefs are dominant today. I argue [without extended justification for now] that we want our doxastic practices to be such that moral beliefs are able make the same passage from the margins to the centre of our moral lives, just as the right of women to vote did. To demand any less of our belief-influencing practices would risk closing our moral community off to progress. As I will argue in chapter four, avoiding this risk is a good reason to allow for substantial interpersonal influence of belief. For now it is sufficient to note that the manner in which moral beliefs are held by different proportions of society over time, gives rise to two claims. First, there is the claim of the exasperated climate scientist, who faced once more with the demand to reconsider the conclusions of their climate research in which the vast majority of society believes says to the climate denialist “my belief that you consider morally significant is so widely accepted that it should not be up for debate”. [Maybe something here about the spurned discoverer of the need to wash hands.] A second claim that arises process something like this: “My moral belief—that polyamorous relationships should enjoy the same legal rights as straight couples, for instance—is currently marginal. I don’t want it’s current unpopularity to prevent it from becoming a common moral belief, and I want to distinguish it from other unpopular moral beliefs that have been discarded by my moral community.” The interests in these claims are prima facie somewhat opposed. The former hopes that the popularity of a morally significant belief grants it some sort of special reprieve from contest and constant justification. The latter hopes that the opposition of a moral belief to another prevailing belief of the time (in this instance the belief that polyamorous couple ought not enjoy the same legal rights as straight couples) does not prevent it from becoming the more common belief. A successful account of legitimate belief-influence will manage these competing interests.

One might rightly point out, at this juncture, that I have not yet given an account of what belief is, nor have I grounded my class of morally significant beliefs by staking positions in the usual range of ontological and epistemic questions that concern the philosophy of belief. I have avoided making such commitments for three reasons. First, this paper is concerned with the justification of interpersonal belief-influencing strategies. Consideration of what precisely belief consists in or its logical structure are regrettably outside the scope of this project. Second, the question of justification that this project is concerned with depends less on what belief consists in and more on what we take to be its moral status. That is to say, if you are satisfied that the class of morally significant beliefs that I have sketched indeed outlines something of moral significance, and you are satisfied that there are somewhat reliable strategies for influencing the members of that class, then those are sufficient grounds to motivate consideration of the justification of belief-influencing strategies. Third, an account of justified interpersonal belief-influence that does not depend on just one account of the nature and ethics of beliefs and instead is compatible with many will be more widely acceptable to philosophers of belief. I intend to offer a broadly acceptable account of justified interpersonal belief-influence, and take this breadth to be an appealing feature of my approach.

To defend this approach, I want to make explicit the three minimal claims I make about the nature of belief in this paper and assess where this leaves me with regard to standard positions in the philosophy of belief. The three claims are:

1. There are moral judgements and beliefs of the type I have termed “morally significant beliefs” which play an important role in our moral lives.
2. These moral judgements and beliefs can more or less reliably influenced by a variety of strategies
3. These moral judgements are to some extent perceptible and reportable

These claims accommodate the most common views in the literature, but cannot hope to allow for them all. I will address each claim and a few concerns in turn.

The first claim is, I take it, reasonably uncontroversial. One might object that the class of morally significant beliefs encompasses too many elements that should not be addressed together. You might think, for instance, that empirical claims should not be grouped with direct moral judgements, and that more care should have been taken to acknowledge and delineate between affective and cognitive components of moral beliefs. These categorisation concerns are important, but not for this project. In the first instance, I reiterate that a belief or moral judgement’s membership of the class of morally significant beliefs does not depend on what one considers belief to consist in. The class merely marks out the range of beliefs that will be of particular interest to our discussion of justified belief-influence and notes several features of this range. The members of the class need not all be of the same kind. Indeed, my account thus far allows that the members of the morally significant belief class could be a mix of cognitive and affective judgements, various attitudes, as well as empirical claims – and any mix therein. Second, I maintain that my account of morally significant beliefs does capture an intuitively graspable set of beliefs that are held, professed and reflected in action in the real world. If this is the case, my discussion has captured something worth studying.
Eliminativists regarding belief would also object to the first claim. Eliminativists deny altogether the existence of that which we refer to as beliefs. On this view, to adopt Churchland’s vivid terms, our observation that we have beliefs “may be as badly misplaced as was the classical man's visual certainty that the star-flecked sphere of the heavens turns daily” [@churchland1981, 70; see also @taylor1994]. I do not have the space[^delusions] to assess responses to the eliminativist position, save to note that it holds a “fairly unpopular” position in the philosophy of belief [@joyce2013, 517]. But
I cannot do anything to convince the eliminativist regarding belief, someone...

[^delusions]: This is the first footnote. I wonder if it you can @taylor1994 in it.

I am happy to keep this class broad, and focus our discussion on the central cases of beliefs of frequently contested and particularly morally significant beliefs.

I've suggested there[@haidt2001; @farte2016] is an intuitively graspable class of beliefs that are morally significant. I've gone to some lengths to indicate the shape of this class, and noted that it does not need to be narrowly defined for the success of this project. I have identified several features of morally significant beliefs - they are a broad class, they come in significant degrees, and they are socially and temporally contingent - that will inform our later discussion. I've further explicated what

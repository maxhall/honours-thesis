# Changing one's mind on moral matters

## Introduction

"Optimists" and the persuasion literature  who prioritise persuasion presume:
1. Good faith, reasons-giving discussion will converge on agreement and thruth
2. That there is accessible moral truth and facts in a concrete circumstance
3. This process is the only way of changing minds

## A typology of moral arguments

* Lists situations that appear to be moral disagreement but are not
* Defines moral disagreement
	* The difference is then in the set of relevant values and priorities each person holds (279)
* Identifies three types of these
	1. Resolvable disagreement
	2. Irresolvable disagreement (Agree to disagree)
	3. Radical disagreement. Does not address in total, but is really interesting - look for references.
